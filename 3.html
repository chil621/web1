  <h2>JavaScript</h2>
  <p>
    JavaScript (/'dʒɑ:va,skript/[6]), often abbreviated as JS, is a high level,<br>
    dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based, multi-paradigm, and interprected programming <br>
    language. Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologes <br>
    of world wide web content production.<br>
    It is used to make webpages interactive and provide online programers, <br>
    including video games. The majority of websites employ it,<br>
    and all modern web browsers support it without the need for plug-ins by <br>
    means of a built-in JavaScript engine.<br>
    Each of the many JavaScript engines represent a different implementation <br>
    of JavaScript , all based on the ECMAScript specification, with some <br>
    engines not supporting the spec fully, and with many engines supporting <br>
    additional features beyond ECMA.
